        Imagine this, you are logging into your desktop as usual, 
        and you check all of your notifications, replying and noting of them all. 
        However, you receive a link. Usually, you would not press it, however, 
        it has the name of your favourite game, a game you have been playing since
        before you could talk. Not only does it have the name, but a voucher attached, 
        can you resist the urge? See what happens as you undergo this journey of self-guidance
        as you navigate some hard realities of cyber security. Most importantly, enjoy the ride.
