      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
      <p>Imagine this, you are logging into your desktop as usual, 
        and you check all of your notifications, replying and noting of them all. 
        However, you receive a link. Usually, you would not press it, however, it has 
        the name of your favourite game, a game you have been playing since before you 
        could talk. Not only does it have the name, but a voucher attached, can you resist
        the urge? See what happens as you undergo this journey of self-guidance as you navigate
         some hard realities of cyber security. Most importantly, enjoy the ride. </p>
