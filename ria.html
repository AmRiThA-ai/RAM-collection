                Imagine this, you are logging into your desktop as usual, and you check all of your notifications, 
                replying and noting of them all. However, you receive a link. Usually, you would not press it,
                however, it has the name of your favourite game, a game you have been playing since before you could talk. 
                Not only does it have the name, but a voucher attached, can you resist the urge? See what happens as you 
                undergo this journey of self-guidance as you navigate some hard realities of cyber security. Most importantly,
                enjoy the ride.
